I build AI products by programming and talking a lot.

- 2023 - Joined [phospho (YC W24)](https://phospho.ai), an AI startup, as a **Founding Engineer** (first employee). I accelerate the adoption of the latest AI technologies in Paris and San Francisco.
- 2022-2023 - Joined the consulting firm _[QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/how-we-help-clients)_ as a **Data Scientist**. I traveled accross Europe to help large companies progress on GenAI, future mobility, and business analytics.
- 2021-2022 - Joined [Ynstant](https://www.ynstant.io), a carpooling startup, as a **co-founder**. I'll never forget when I actually got into a car thanks to the app I built from scratch. Student loans stopped me in this adventure.
- 2015-2022 - Survived French ["prépa classes"](https://aphec.fr/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Introducing_The_PREPA_Classes_in_THE_FRENCH_HIGHER_EDUCATION_SYSTEM.pdf) and graduated from [HEC Paris](https://www.hec.edu/en) and [Télécom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/home), with a **double degree in business and engineering**. I did internships at the [Criteo](https://www.criteo.com) AI Lab (online ads R&D), [Foundamental](https://www.foundamental.com) (Berlin construction VC fund), and [Skillup](https://www.skillup.co) (Paris startup).

I made this blog to share my stories and the cool stuff I learned in data science, programming, and mathematics.
